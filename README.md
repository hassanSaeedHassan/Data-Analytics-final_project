# Data-Analytics-final_project

# introduction:
Bank account fraud is a significant problem for financial institutions, causing significant financial losses and damages the customer’s trust. Fraudulent bank account opening applications can be used to commit various financial crimes, such as money laundering, identity theft, and terrorist financing. Detecting and preventing fraudulent bank account opening applications is critical to the financial institution’s success by reducing their exposure to financial and reputational risks. However, it is challenging to detect these fraudulent applications since only a small percentage of applications are labeled as positive, and the data is highly imbalanced.
The main user groups that would benefit from the outcome of this project are financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and individuals. Financial institutions will
benefit from more accurate fraud detection, which can help them minimize financial losses and maintain customer trust. Law enforcement agencies can use these models to identify
and prosecute fraudsters. Individuals can benefit from more secure banking services, as they won’t be denied to open accounts as banks would be able to put more trust in their
models’ results. By continuously monitoring and improving their fraud detection capabilities, these financial entities can stay ahead of evolving fraud threats and protect themselves and their
customers from financial harm.
